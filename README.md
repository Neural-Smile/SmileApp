# SmileApp
## Description
Broker for the neural smile project

## Development
To run a development server, clone the project and run `bundle install` inside the repo. If you don't have `bundle`, then install ruby with your package manager and run `gem install bundler` (might need sudo) first.

After you bundler install all the required packages (including rails), you can run a local rails server by simply running:

```
rails server
```
